      I'm Tien Cheng, a graduate of Singapore Polytechnic (SP) with a Diploma in
      Applied AI and Analytics, and a recipient of the Singapore Computer
      Society Silver Medal. As a former co-founder and operations department
      head of SPAI (an AI Singapore Student Chapter) in AY21/22, I actively
      promoted the field of Data Science during my time at SP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm a full-time national serviceman (i.e conscript) at the <a
        href="https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/dis/"
        >Digital and Intelligence Service</a
      >, but I also work on personal projects and competitions in my free time.
      After serving NS, I'll be doing an Computer Science undergrad at the
      National University of Singapore.

          Flora is a tech startup that builds software to help organisations
          manage their information, with our primary product being an enterprise
          search application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a custom search engine using Elasticsearch, and a
          microservice architecture using Jina and MongoDB, to enable
          organisations to index and search through their data sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed unit tests for the AI microservices using Pytest, and also
          set up a Kubeflow pipeline on Vertex AI for running evaluation of our
          neural search engine using BEIR.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trained a custom object detection model using MMYOLO for document
          layout detection, applying techniques like knowledge distillation to
          improve inference speed by four times while also improving mean
          average precision (mAP) from 0.41 to 0.5 (a 21.95% improvement).
        </li>
        <li>
          Deployed the application on Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, and
          also performed on-premise deployment as part of a trial run for a
          client.
        </li>
        <li>
          Used OpenTelemetry in combination with Prometheus and Grafana to track
          and monitor the performance of the application, helping to identify
          and resolve memory leaks and bottlenecks.

      <ul class="list-disc mx-6 mb-10 grid gap-2">
        <li>
          Core developer of the AI App Store project, an in-house platform built
          using Vue.js and FastAPI for AI developers to publish and share their
          models in the form of model cards, and deploy containers as KNative
          services through a GUI interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed API endpoints to enable the managing of services in a
          Kubernetes cluster through the app, as well as integration with the
          ClearML platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a custom WYSIWYG editor using the TipTap library, enabling
          the insertion of editable Plotly.js graphs within the markup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wrote and maintained unit tests, and established automated testing
          through a CI pipeline deployed on GitHub Actions, resulting in a more
          reliable and robust application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up Helm charts, documentation and deployed the project on a
          Kubernetes cluster for use internally by two departments within DSTA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contributed to a separate team project where I developed microservices
          for a prototype real time video analytics pipeline, integrating models
          like YOLOv5 and ByteTrack, using PyTorch, OpenCV, Triton Inference
          Server and Apache Kafka.
